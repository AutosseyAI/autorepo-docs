## 2. Select Repositories

GitHub Apps can be enabled on all repositories, or only on select repositories. Select which repositories you want to connect to Autorepo.

<Note>
  **Note:** Autorepo will not perform any actions unless directly prompted with the `auto` label.
</Note>

By selecting all repositories, new repositories you create will automatically be able to use Autorepo as well. Repositories can be added or removed at any time from the [GitHub App settings page](https://github.com/settings/installations).
