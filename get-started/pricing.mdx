## Free Tier

Autorepo is free to use in both private and public repositories. However, the free tier may be less capable and more prone to mistakes.

## Standard Tier

To upgrade to the standard tier, visit the Autorepo Dashboard at [app.autorepo.io](https://app.autorepo.io) and connect a payment method with Stripe.

The standard tier is priced on a pay-as-you-go basis. No subscription is required to use the service. You only pay for what you use.

## Free Credits

Free credits are also available to try the standard tier. If you run out of free credits, you will automatically be downgraded to the free tier.

Email [hello@autorepo.io](mailto:hello@autorepo.io) if you would like to try Autorepo with free credits.
