Autorepo can perform research within your codebase and across the web to add additional context to issues.


## 1. Create an Issue

Create a new issue in a repo that you have [connected with Autorepo](/installing).

## 2. Add the `auto` label

When Autorepo detects an issue with the `auto` label, it will react with the eyes emoji (ðŸ‘€), and then comment to confirm that it has started working on the issue.
