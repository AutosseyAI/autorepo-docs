Autorepo can create step-by-step plans to complete issues.

## 1. Create an Issue

Create a new issue in a repo that you have [connected with Autorepo](/installing). Give the issue a title and body explaining the change you want to make.

Providing more details will help Autorepo create a better plan, but a detailed body is not required. If Autorepo needs clarification, it will make a comment asking for more information.

## 2. Add the `auto` label

When Autorepo detects an issue with the `auto` label, it will react with the [eyes emoji ðŸ‘€](/get-started/anatomy#marked-as-seen), and comment with a [placeholder comment ðŸ§ ](/get-started/anatomy#autorepo-is-thinking-banner) to let you know it is typing a response.

<Note>
  Autorepo will only run tasks if a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) adds the `auto` label.
</Note>

## 3. Autorepo Creates a Plan

Autorepo will respond with clarifying questions as necessary. Once Autorepo understands the issue, it will create a checklist of tasks to complete the issue.
