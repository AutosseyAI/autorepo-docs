Autorepo can perform research within your codebase and across the web to add additional context to issues.


## 1. Create an Issue

Create a new issue in a repo that you have [connected with Autorepo](/installing).

## 2. Add the `auto` label

When Autorepo detects an issue with the `auto` label, it will react with the eyes emoji (ðŸ‘€), and then comment to confirm that it has started working on the issue.

<Note>
  Autorepo will only run tasks if a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) adds the `auto` label.
